# CSBEF.Module.UserActionLog
This is an official module created for CSBEF. The module keeps track of the transactions performed in all modules within the API. In order to do this work, the module, which is included in all events, keeps the records in its own database table.

# Current Version
Version: 1.0.2 ([latest release](https://github.com/mkurak/CSBEF.Module.UserActionLog/releases/tag/1.0.2))

# Status
Completed, there is no planned development.

# Very Soon
I am preparing a comprehensive documentation of the project. But since I developed it alone, I cannot do everything at the same time :) So I will finish the documentation as soon as possible and publish it here.

# What is needed?
Is an urgent need for the translation. Turkish will prepare documentation must be translated into English. Another friend of mine is preparing her German. If Turkish - English translation and will do If you can spare time, the project will have a major contribution.
